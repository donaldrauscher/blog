I recently started using ["Shiny":http://shiny.rstudio.com/] by RStudio to make sleak web apps for some of the analyses that I frequenty conduct, namely customer customer segmentation.  Shiny allows you to make simple, browser-based web applications that run R in the background. Check out the ["gallery":http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/] to see some examples. 

Shiny has a couple features that I think make it really powerful and useful:
* <b>Reactive programming</b>: With Shiny, you can break your analyses into pieces with various dependencies.  Let's say A depends on X and Y and B depends on just Y.  If X changes, only A will refresh, not Y.  This allows you to build pretty complex applications powered by lots of interdependent analyses. 
* <b>Image output rending</b>: Because Shiny can output images to the browser (in addition to simple text and HTML), you can use plotting systems such as ["ggplot2":http://ggplot2.org/] to generate graphs and visual outputs for your app.  You can also use D3 to create data visualizations (see link below).

I put together a Shiny app (["https://github.com/donaldrauscher/treeseg":https://github.com/donaldrauscher/treeseg]) that creates objective-based segmentations.  I built the segmentation trees with a package called ["Rpart":http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rpart/index.html].  You can toggle which variables you want to use to build the tree.  The app also profiles the segmentation for you, conducting stat tests on all variables in the data (both numeric and categorical).  The app will allow you to rapidly prototype segmentation solutions.
