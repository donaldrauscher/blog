Here's my solution to [this week's 538 Riddler](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/can-you-solve-the-puzzle-of-the-overflowing-martini-glass/):
[<img src="/img/martini-riddler.jpg" width="885x">](/img/martini-riddler.jpg)

If the liquid reaches <span class="equation" data-expr="p"></span> fraction of the way up the glass when upright, then the liquid goes <span class="equation" data-expr="p^2"></span> fraction of the way up the glass on the opposite side just before it begins to pour.  

[Dandelin spheres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dandelin_spheres) were key to my proof. They prove that the top of the liquid (a conic section) forms an ellipse, and they help pinpoint the location of one of the ellipse's foci.  I derived two expressions for the volume of the liquid (one pouring, one upright) and set them equal to one another.  Interestly, the steepness of the glass <span class="equation" data-expr="\theta"></span> in my proof), drops out of the expression.  

Looking forward to next week's Riddler!
