I had to create a heat map the other day with CBSA-level data.  I found a good example using D3 ["here":http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606].  However, this one was formatted to take in county-level data.  

Mike Bostock has a great ["tutorial":http://bost.ocks.org/mike/map/] on making TopoJSON files (TopoJSON files are slimmed down GeoJSON files where redundant edges are deduplicated).  I more-or-less followed that to create a TopoJSON file with CBSA and state shapes in it, using 2014 TIGER data.  It's less than 2Mb.  Then I made some small updates to the D3 code to take in my CBSA-level data.  Feel free to fork ["https://github.com/donaldrauscher/choropleth":https://github.com/donaldrauscher/choropleth].

Cheers.
